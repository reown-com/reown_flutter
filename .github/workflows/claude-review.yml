            This is a Flutter/Dart SDK implementing the WalletConnect protocol for Flutter applications.
            
            Tech Stack:
            - Flutter SDK with Dart 3.3.3+
            - AppKit and WalletKit implementations
            - Multi-chain support (EVM, Solana, Polkadot, Kadena, Tron, Cosmos)
            
            Key Considerations:
            - Follow Flutter/Dart best practices and conventions
            - Ensure proper async/await patterns
            - Maintain type safety and null safety
            - Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web)
            - Proper error handling for blockchain operations
